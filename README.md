# OpenCV-Python
Python program for Face Recognition and Identification using the Open Source Computer Vision Library

## Requirements

In order to run the .py file you must have Python 3 installed. 
Python libraries needed: [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/), [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)...

## Implementation

Insert in the [images](https://github.com/federicovilla55/OpenCV-Python/tree/master/images) directory some subfolders containing the photos for recognition.
Then run [OpenCV-Training.py](https://github.com/federicovilla55/OpenCV-Python/blob/main/OpenCV-Training.py) for configuration (creating trainer.yml and \pickles\face-labels).
